# autocomplete-latex

## Installing
Run `apm install autocomplete-latex` or through atom's builtin package manager.

## Adding completions
Look in docs for format, feature not currently availible.

## Other packages
I also made a grammar scoper, but that's still a work in progress as well. Maybe some day I'll have completed a suite of packages that all work well together (and are compatible with any others).
